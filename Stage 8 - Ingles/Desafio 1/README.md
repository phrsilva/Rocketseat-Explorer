# Rocketseat Explorer - Stage 08 | English Challenge

## The Challenge

This project tackles the basic concepts of HTML and CSS as tought in the first stages of the Rockseat Explorer course. 

But here i'm refactoring the same code and translating variables and comments to the English language, which is pretty much the standard language when it comes to programming and developing IT solutions.

This exercise helps to improve my English while making the code more readable and easier to understand for others.
